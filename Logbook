# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1st, 2022 


**Today's Progress**: Started React basics course on Scrimba, 1 hour (7 videos)

**Thoughts:** Started the React course in preparation for my classes beginning at the end of January.
So far I like React but can already tell that it will change my way of thinking about layout and separation of concerns. Curious to find out more.

---

### Day 2: January 2nd, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Continued React basics course, 2 hours (10 videos)

**Thoughts**: Great pace of the course, it all makes a lot of sense. Enjoying writing React which is good. Learned the concept of components, more syntax differences (compared to HTML) when using JSX for components, started simple navbar styling in CSS for React component. Managed to get the final 20 minutes of study in, feeling proud of myself.

--- 

### Day 3: January 3rd, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Repeated CSS styling of React components section, revision of how to style navbar and footer, how to use flexbox to align items horizontally and add the correct spacing between them, played around with styling, good repetition. 

**Thoughts**: Glad I took the time to revise these topics. Still unsure how to wrap the component sections into a flex wrapper as the main component and the header / footer are in different divs. Going to find out until tomorrow.

**Link to work**: First static React page with navbar, list and footer, all styled with CSS, not displaying in browser due to dependencies


--- 

### Day 4: January 4th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to organise components into their own files and how to import/export them. Then took a deep dive into installing node via nvm, learning more about the commmand line while I was at it. 

**Thoughts**: Feels like not much progress today while it feels like a lot at the same time. Not comfortable installing programs through the terminal yet for some reason, unfamiliar UI. Hoping it will all come together and make sense shortly. 

**Link to work**: not today, theoretical day reorganising code and installing node and nvm

--- 

### Day 5: January 5th, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Today I took a deep dive into node.js in an attempt to understand better what it is and does, after I installed it yesterday via the command line. Trying to get a solid mental model of node.js, nvm, npm. Second half of the coding today was building a Javascript clock from scratch, but I built a timer instead haha. Having another go at this tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: Feeling a bit discouraged by the vastness of every topic I come across when doing simple repetition, like node.js. Every new term is a whole new world, and it is easy to get overwhelmed. Just like starting a project from scratch and then going down the wrong rabbit hole. But that is ok, I will push on and weather the storm of new knowledge, I can do this. Also Revised my resume today.

---

### Day 6: January 6th, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Today I:
- learned how to add a collaborator on github (working on a collaborative side project)
- made mindmap of what I know so far including node, npm, npx, nvm, shells 
- learned more about foundational knowledge regarding terminal, shells (bash, powershell, cmd)
- installed react app and started my first react app
- continued with my react course
- am making the clock project from yesterday

**Thoughts**: Going to collect as many pieces of information I can to connect current knowledge in mindmap and expand as I continue on this journey. Excited to finally get started with React, figuring out best way to run a page in a way I can display it here

---

### Day 7: January 7th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Git, completed video tutorial and practiced git commands, creating directories, cloning repos, staging and committing changes. Big step there. Then moved onto Javascript calculator project and feeling overwhelmed. Considering taking a step back to JavaScript?

**Thoughts**: Not a great day mentally, really struggling to assess if I am overstretching by going for a React course while expanding JavaScript foundations.

**Link to work**: Nothing today except for a few command line git screenshots and a half finished calculator

---

### Day 8: January 8th, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Learned about APIs, wrote my first fetch(), was super excited when it worked. Sorted through all my notes from studying over the past months for review.
Continued on JavaScript calculator collaboration, successfully finished including an addition to the code that makes it a broken calculator (for a challenge entry), learned about modal boxes on the side, just need to finish some formatting tomorrow. Revised git commands. Many hours of coding today, at least 4.

**Thoughts**: Feeling much better about my progress than yesterday. More and more dots connect and every day I know more.

---

### Day 9: January 9th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned more about APIs, built Bored Bot which suggests random activities and displays a random dog picture to cheer the bored person up. People I know have successfully used it so far, which was fun. Updated my entire Github (all repos), added readme notes, linked to correct Twitter, learned how to properly fork a repo I was a contributor on to display latest version on my Github.

**Thoughts**: Very productive day, really implemented API knowledge and practiced CSS styling as well as DOM manipulation with JavaScript.

---

### Day 10: January 10, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about servers & clients, requeset/response cycle, request components (URL, method, body, headers), JSON. Practiced slice() again when using part of the array that was requested to build a blog post project. Made some progress in CSS revision (typography - using margin and padding of text elements to balance gaps) and solved remaining issue with current JavaScript project (calculator) - sometimes a bigger resolution image file is the solution, not more css!

**Thoughts**: Working on different areas at once is helpful to keep me engaged in learning, and often the different sections come together during a project.

---

### Day 11: January 11th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Created first React page with React app, revised React knowledge so far. Attended 2h Intro to Google Analytics seminar, confirmed I am more interested in coding than I am in marketing but good to know more about this side of things as well. Lastly practiced JavaScript concepts, modal and started searchbar that matches against usernames. 

**Thoughts**: Looking forward to adding more JavaScript concepts to my skill base, finding the coding exercises easier slowly but surely. Learning to think a certain way. React is still fun and makes a lot of sense to me.

**Link to work**: [Modal Practice](https://criminy-git.github.io/modal/)

---

### Day 12: January 12th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Practiced JavaScript, made a searchbar for a username list, practising includes() to search current user input against a user list and change display property pracitising DOM manipulation.

**Thoughts**: Really tired today from first day back at work after some weeks of leave, feeling annoyed that work is taking up a lot of time and energy during the day. Proud I still stuck with coding today, even if I just got one step ahead, better than none.

---

### Day 13: January 13th, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Started reading book about JavaScript, learned what REST API means, revised styling of blog project.

**Thoughts**: Really tired again after work. Need to find better energy management. Looking forward to the weekend to study more.

---

### Day 14: January 17th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Read Chapter 2 of Eloquent JavaScript. Tried to refactor colour palette generator code using modules. Half succeeded. To be continued tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: Took some time off over the weekend to avoid burning out. Hard to get back into it due to lacking confidence when it comes to modules

---


### Day 15: January 18th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished Applied Visual Design course. Practised JavaScript and modularising applications.

**Thoughts**: Back into the swing of things, just needed to find a new rythmn with work.


---

### Day 16: January 19th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Revised JavaScript, really focusing on strengthening the foundations and closing any little gaps there may have been.

**Thoughts**: Feeling good about reaching out for support. Solved a problem with an issue with a JavaScript program at work that the developer himself couldn't solve, felt good to apply analytical problem solving skills.

---


### Day 17: January 20th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Solved JavaScript coding questions, started a new project to streamline my day job. Started chapter three of Eloquent JavaScript. Learned about XML http requests and control flow.

**Thoughts**: Going to continue JavaScript revision until the end of the week and then focus back on React.

---

### Day 18: January 21th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Picked a concept to learn about today. Closures vs scope. Learned a lot about both, their differences and how they compare to each other, took notes, studied examples and built my own simple analogies. Learned defition of terms "callback" and "IDE". Started to learn more about network requests, learned about stack, how it works throughout execution of an async function. Continued Chapter 3.

**Thoughts**: Sometimes it is important to come back to a topic after having picked up a different topic first which helps with understanding of the first concept.

---

### Day 19: January 22th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today's concept: Promises. Finished API project using fetch() with promises to make 150 network requests at once. Signed up to Leetcode and aiming to solve one problem daily. Practised git commands, pushing updated files to Github. Read about clean code principles. 

**Thoughts**: Productive day! Important to take breaks and come back to a problems.
 Starting to build a strong habit coding regularly. Focus of these study times could be improved as skipping between topics a lot trying to cover all JS basics before React course at starts 1st of Feb.
              Realising I cannot possibly cover it all, will refocus on React from tomorrow on and continue JavaScript learning on the side (about an hour a day, plus 1 daily coding exercise on Leetcode, which falls under interview prep as well).
              Having tried to built my own program at work and having gone through debugging, realising that is the way to go to learn. Plus building simple (paper scissors rock game) throughout practices where I understand each layer of code
              instead of white-knuckling through a project like the snake game without being able to grasp level 33 of the code, is the much better approach. Live and learn.
              Would also like to do something like 100devs, but no capacity with self learning from various ressources, book, own projects, mentoring and the course about to start. 
              Finally got great feedback from three separate friends about my capabilites and love for learning yesterday, which further motivates me.

### Day 20: January 23rd, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started a new API project to transfer knowledge, team project for a challenge entry.
Finished React pre-work for course, repeated starting a React app from scratch, practiced more command line. 
Learned difference between state and props.

**Thoughts**: Lots of new information at once this weekend.
Happy when I figured out how to adapt code to access different object properties within an API object.

---

### Day 21: January 24th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about promises and practised in current API project (challenge entry).
Learned about React class components and state. Started React TicTacToe game.

**Thoughts**: Spent pretty much all day coding. CSS in the evening was almost like a break, but did enjoy React.
Just need to sort all the information in my head.

---

### Day 22: January 25th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Tried to understand promises, callback functions and Async JavaScript better.
Practiced git. Working through JS fundamentals with GA prep course, filling in more gaps. 

**Thoughts**: There's a long way to go.

---

### Day 23: January 26th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Found a good resource explaining callback functions. Finished API team project, 
didn't get everything implemented I wanted but not a bad outcome.

**Thoughts**: Time to refocus on the course along with fundamentals.

**Link to work**: [Second API project practising promises](https://criminy-git.github.io/api-challenge-project/)

---

### Day 24: January 27th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Practiced exercises from Eloquent JavaScript again, JS revision. 
Attended intro to my General Assembly course starting next week!!

**Thoughts**: Slow and steady wins the race.

---

### Day 26: January 28th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Only repeated one exercise today (chessboard) but nailed it, just knew what to do and how to
build the code block logically without memorising any code etc, it was a great moment.
All coming from a lot of trial and error when learning, led to greater understanding.
Confident I could replicate this solution any time with varying degrees of
reusability of code, could produce intentional variations of the outcome as well.

**Thoughts**: On the right track.

---

### Day 27: January 29th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started my first React project by myself with newfound working method of building things through trial and error from scratch, 
following a tutorial but building it myself through create-react-app. Understood a lot more about import/export, what to name components and the import syntax,
how to link a css file in a similar way to a React component. 
Tying in my knowledge of git and command line and npm with all this too.

**Thoughts**: Feel like I am building up my understanding of React from the ground up. Feels good, very low amount of frustration today.

---

###:Day 28: January 31st, 2022

***Today's progress***: Started building mental model to understand how bundlers like webpack and compilers like babel benefit performance of an application.
Repeated three exercises from Eloquent JavaScript Chapter 2, able to debug and solve all threee now (seemed like an impossible mountain two weeks ago).
Read article on var/let/const and scope, solidified my understanding.
-
Read chapter 3 of Eloquent JavaScript.
Attempted leetcode problems.
Progressed in callbacks & promised section of Frontend Career Path.
🏄‍♀️

**Thoughts**: Can see progress in being able to do things I wasn't able to do before.
(Complete challenges chapter 2, read through chapter 3 in one go understanding nearly everything).
Excited about General Assembly React course starting tomorrow but wondering if 
my brain is single or multithreaded. Bad attempt at a programming joke! 😏

Also: Coded 28/31 days in January! Success in building a habit 🎉

**Today's Progress**: Started great React overview tutorial on LinkedIn.
First React live class at GA, met classmates, went over coursework, course structure
and learned difference between fictional and class components as well as npx vs no npx command before react-app

**Thoughts**: Happy that live classes have started and expanded my initial idea for my final project!

---

### Day 30: February 2nd, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Had to take a break tonight, earlier today attended Canva live interview on LinkedIn,
processed in UI module and getting hired advice module.
