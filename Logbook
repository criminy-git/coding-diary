# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1st, 2022 


**Today's Progress**: Started React basics course on Scrimba, 1 hour (7 videos)

**Thoughts:** Started the React course in preparation for my classes beginning at the end of January.
So far I like React but can already tell that it will change my way of thinking about layout and separation of concerns. Curious to find out more.

### Day 2: January 2nd, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Continued React basics course, 2 hours (10 videos)

**Thoughts**: Great pace of the course, it all makes a lot of sense. Enjoying writing React which is good. Learned the concept of components, more syntax differences (compared to HTML) when using JSX for components, started simple navbar styling in CSS for React component. Managed to get the final 20 minutes of study in, feeling proud of myself.

--- 

### Day 3: January 3rd, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Repeated CSS styling of React components section, revision of how to style navbar and footer, how to use flexbox to align items horizontally and add the correct spacing between them, played around with styling, good repetition. 

**Thoughts**: Glad I took the time to revise these topics. Still unsure how to wrap the component sections into a flex wrapper as the main component and the header / footer are in different divs. Going to find out until tomorrow.

**Link to work**: First static React page with navbar, list and footer, all styled with CSS, not displaying in browser due to dependencies

### Day 4: January 4th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to organise components into their own files and how to import/export them. Then took a deep dive into installing node via nvm, learning more about the commmand line while I was at it. 

**Thoughts**: Feels like not much progress today while it feels like a lot at the same time. Not comfortable installing programs through the terminal yet for some reason, unfamiliar UI. Hoping it will all come together and make sense shortly. 

**Link to work**: not today, theoretical day reorganising code and installing node and nvm

### Day 5: January 5th, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Today I took a deep dive into node.js in an attempt to understand better what it is and does, after I installed it yesterday via the command line. Trying to get a solid mental model of node.js, nvm, npm. Second half of the coding today was building a Javascript clock from scratch, but I built a timer instead haha. Having another go at this tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: Feeling a bit discouraged by the vastness of every topic I come across when doing simple repetition, like node.js. Every new term is a whole new world, and it is easy to get overwhelmed. Just like starting a project from scratch and then going down the wrong rabbit hole. But that is ok, I will push on and weather the storm of new knowledge, I can do this. Also Revised my resume today.

### Day 6: January 6th, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Today I:
- learned how to add a collaborator on github (working on a collaborative side project)
- made mindmap of what I know so far including node, npm, npx, nvm, shells 
- learned more about foundational knowledge regarding terminal, shells (bash, powershell, cmd)
- installed react app and started my first react app
- continued with my react course
- am making the clock project from yesterday

**Thoughts**: Going to collect as many pieces of information I can to connect current knowledge in mindmap and expand as I continue on this journey. Excited to finally get started with React, figuring out best way to run a page in a way I can display it here

### Day 7: January 7th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Git, completed video tutorial and practiced git commands, creating directories, cloning repos, staging and committing changes. Big step there. Then moved onto Javascript calculator project and feeling overwhelmed. Considering taking a step back to JavaScript?

**Thoughts**: Not a great day mentally, really struggling to assess if I am overstretching by going for a React course while expanding JavaScript foundations.

**Link to work**: Nothing today except for a few command line git screenshots and a half finished calculator

---

### Day 8: January 8th, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Learned about APIs, wrote my first fetch(), was super excited when it worked. Sorted through all my notes from studying over the past months for review.
Continued on JavaScript calculator collaboration, successfully finished including an addition to the code that makes it a broken calculator (for a challenge entry), learned about modal boxes on the side, just need to finish some formatting tomorrow. Revised git commands. Many hours of coding today, at least 4.

**Thoughts**: Feeling much better about my progress than yesterday. More and more dots connect and every day I know more.

### Day 9: January 9th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned more about APIs, built Bored Bot which suggests random activities and displays a random dog picture to cheer the bored person up. People I know have successfully used it so far, which was fun. Updated my entire Github (all repos), added readme notes, linked to correct Twitter, learned how to properly fork a repo I was a contributor on to display latest version on my Github.

**Thoughts**: Very productive day, really implemented API knowledge and practiced CSS styling as well as DOM manipulation with JavaScript.

### Day 10: January 10, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about servers & clients, requeset/response cycle, request components (URL, method, body, headers), JSON. Practiced slice() again when using part of the array that was requested to build a blog post project. Made some progress in CSS revision (typography - using margin and padding of text elements to balance gaps) and solved remaining issue with current JavaScript project (calculator) - sometimes a bigger resolution image file is the solution, not more css!

**Thoughts**: Working on different areas at once is helpful to keep me engaged in learning, and often the different sections come together during a project.

---

### Day 11: January 11th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Created first React page with React app, revised React knowledge so far. Attended 2h Intro to Google Analytics seminar, confirmed I am more interested in coding than I am in marketing but good to know more about this side of things as well. Lastly practiced JavaScript concepts, modal and started searchbar that matches against usernames. 

**Thoughts**: Looking forward to adding more JavaScript concepts to my skill base, finding the coding exercises easier slowly but surely. Learning to think a certain way. React is still fun and makes a lot of sense to me.

### Day 12: January 12th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Practiced JavaScript, made a searchbar for a username list, practising includes() to search current user input against a user list and change display property pracitising DOM manipulation.

**Thoughts**: Really tired today from first day back at work after some weeks of leave, feeling annoyed that work is taking up a lot of time and energy during the day. Proud I still stuck with coding today, even if I just got one step ahead, better than none.

### Day 13: January 13th, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Started reading book about JavaScript, learned what REST API means, revised styling of blog project.

**Thoughts**: Really tired again after work. Need to find better energy management. Looking forward to the weekend to study more.
